## ✨ Why "Logo Only" is Best for You

1. **School Name Already Prominent**
   - Hero section shows "Pearl Matriculation Higher Secondary School"
   - Don't need to repeat in nav bar

2. **Navigation Bar Already Has Menu**
   - Home, About Us, Academics, Gallery, etc. remind users what school this is
   - Extra text is redundant

3. **Modern Design Trend**
   - Top brands (Apple, Google, etc.) use just logo
   - Clean, professional appearance

4. **More Space**
   - Navigation items get more breathing room
   - Better proportions

5. **Visual Balance**
   - Large logo stands out
   - Text next to it creates imbalance

6. **Professional Appearance**
   - No clutter
   - Elegant and refined
   - Institutional authority

## 🚀 Implementation Options

### If You Choose Option 1 (Logo Only)
```dart
// Just remove the Column with text
// Keep only the Logo Container
// Result: Clean, professional nav bar
```

### If You Choose Option 3 (Logo + EST)
```dart
// Add small text below/within logo area
// Show: "EST 2004" or "EST 2004"
// Positioned subtly under logo
```

### If You Choose Option 2 (Single Line)
```dart
// Replace two lines with one
// "Pearl Matriculation School"
// Smaller font to keep clean
```

- ✅ Cleanest, most modern
- ✅ Professional and elegant
